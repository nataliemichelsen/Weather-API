# Weather-API

The task was to create a weather data app that enabled the user to input their city or zip code for and get current weather data for their area. 
There were several factors that needed to be accounted for as well, such as UV Index, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. 
The entire page needed to be laid out properly so that all data was presented in an organized fashion. 
In order to create this page, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JS sheets and pushed my work to my GitHub repository. 
The HTML code set the grid layout for the entire page. 
It also linked all relevant pages together and housed the external links such as bootstrap and the weather API, as well as internal links to the .js and .css files. 
The CSS code enabled the generalized styling of the page. 
The JS script enabled all functions to work properly and allowed the weather API data to be called and incorporated into the functions.
